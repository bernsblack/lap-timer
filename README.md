# [Lap Timer](https://bernsblack.github.io/lap-timer/)

Lap Time is a simple lap timer I built during lockdown, when we weren't allowed outside and I had to run laps in the driveway if I wanted to exercise. I placed my phone against the garage door so that I could touch the count button every time I completed a lap. The app displays the total laps, total time, current lap time, and all previous lap times, highlighting the fastest lap in red.
